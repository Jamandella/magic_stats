Building the database:
1. Put buildgamedata.py, statfunctions.py, and tablebuilding.py in the same directory.
2. Download the 17lands premier draft game data for LTR. Save the CSV as "game_data_public.LTR.PremierDraft.csv" 
in the same directory as "buildgamedata.py", or change the value of "address" in buildgamedata.py to that file's location.
3. Run buildgamedata.py. If you want to reduce the sample size to save space and time, uncomment the date filtering line.
(We will later want to do steps 2 and 3 for draft data too, but that is not currently in use and is even larger)
4. Add a file dbpgstrings.py to the folder. It should have values of host, database, user, and password for the postgres database in the form "host=...  database=... user=.... password=...."
5. Run tablebuilding.py. To build a local database run the function builddb(conn1). To build the postgres database run builddb(conn2).

Definitions and descriptions of the content of each table can be found in tablebuilding.py
