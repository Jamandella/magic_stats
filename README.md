## About
<!-- Provide an introduction to your project. Explain its purpose, goals, and any context that might be helpful for readers. -->

The goal of this project is to provide Magic: the Gathering (MTG) draft archetype statistics and insights. We achieve this by analyzing data from Magic Arena drafts, provided by [17 Lands](https://www.17lands.com/). While we draw inspiration from 17 Lands and share some similarities, it's essential to note that we are not affiliated with 17 Lands. Instead, we consider 23 Spells a supplement to 17 Lands, with a specific focus on providing archetype contextual statistics.

### Project Objectives

Our primary objectives are to:
- Analyze data from Magic Arena drafts to identify the performance of different draft archetypes.
- Offer archetype contextual statistics, shedding light on how card performance varies across different deck archetypes.
- Offer data-driven recommendations for draft picks, helping players make informed decisions.

### Motivation

As avid Magic: the Gathering players and fans of 17 Lands, we were inspired to embark on this project by our shared passion for MTG drafting. We believe in the value of 17 Lands' data and recognize that there is still ample room for expansion in the realm of statistical analysis, offering new and valuable information to drafters.

### Target Audience

This project is specifically designed for Magic: the Gathering draft enthusiasts who are passionate about enhancing their drafting skills and gaining a deeper understanding of
